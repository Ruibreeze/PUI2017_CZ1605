## Review:

#### CLARITY: 
* It is great that the caption part provides detail description of the figure.
* There are 5 subplots with an overall y axis label, 5 different x axis labels, and 5 linear regression results of the correlation between assessed value of property and square footage of various kinds of property in a community district. Your idea of making Y and X axes the same across plots to allow for an intuitive comparison is great but I think this way of visulization brings the following negative effects.
* The Y axis of each subplot is so short that lots of scatters can not be seen clearly
* The X axes are the same, only showing and comparing different ranges of the square footage of various kinds of property in all districts which is not a very useful information.
* The bottom suplot is too small with scatters and fit line only located on the left corner.
* There should a title briefly introduing the content of this plot.
* I think it is better to make 5 individual plots to show the linear regression results.

#### AETHETIC: 
* The whole plot only has two colors, including black and gray. I think using more colorful colors will attract readers more since there are 5 subplots.

# FBB the number of colors is apppropriate to display the info as each plot has a single variable 

#### HONESTY: 
* The plot shows 5 simple linear regression results and honestly reproduces the data.

esthetics: the poor resolution of the plot is distracting and unappealing

the points are at the edge of the x and y axis: this is a poor esthetic choice: while all the info content is there (or would be there if there were labels on the axis) it is distracting - on the other end the x axis on the right side extends inexplicably past the farthest datapoint. this unbalance is also distracting

clarity the points overlap and cluster in a way that makes them undistinguishable - consider using the alpha channel (transparency)

the x labeles are way too small for comfortable reading

the comparison between the slopes is difficult both because of how the plots are organized (one below the other, which is the worse organization to compare slopes) and because, as you mentioned, of the different lencth

while the multiple small plots is in the spirit of Tufte's "small multiples" the missing x and y axis are an issue. Tufte would be horrified by the omission. With different axis length this information is essential. If all plots had the same axis span and units (like I think is the case for the y axis) it would be reasonable to omit in all but one of the plots. Also to encourage comparison the plot should be more compact: reduce the y space between panels
