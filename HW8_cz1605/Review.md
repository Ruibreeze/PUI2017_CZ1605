Review of plot 

## The topic is about the linear correlation between EUI, Energy star score of the mutifamily housing reported in LL84 in 2014

CLARITY: 

This plot has lables on both the x and y axis, but does not provide units. I would suggest putting in what units EUI is measured in, and 
providing information about the possible range of Energy Star Scores so viewers are better able to contextualize the information. What is the maximum Energy Star Score possible? It is not the typical value of 100. The text is clear, but black rather than grey may be even clearer for the labels. There is no title, and should be. Part of the first sentence of the caption could be converted into the title, leaving the data source. I would suggest the caption be more clearly divided into 'data source' and 'significance of plot'. 

Color Blindness: Checking the graph with Color Oracle, the 3 types of color blindness featured can all see the fit line as distinct from the points.  

ESTHETIC: 

The esthetic is functional. Blue and red are typical defaults for this kind of chart. The legend seems to be too large for the lack of additional information it provides. The size and brightness of color draws attention, but reading the information is not necessary. Maybe put 'with fit line' in the title instead and remove legend. Suggestion for title: "EUI versus Energy Star Score, with linear regression fit line". This information is also provided in the caption. 

HONESTY:

I like that the caption provides the R^2 and tells us what the plot tells us that cannot be gained from simply reading that statistic (that there is a visible negative correlation). The plot seems to be honestly reproducing the data. I would like to know if any outliers have been removed/cropped.
